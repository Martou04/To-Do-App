# Todo React App
## ‚úÖ Completed Requirements
This project was developed in full compliance with all the requirements outlined in the Todo React App Requirements document.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Additional Implementations
In addition to the mandatory requirements, the following enhancements were implemented:

* localStorage integration:
  * Todos, Users, and LoggedInUser are saved in localStorage.
  * On initial load:
    * If data exists in localStorage ‚Üí it is loaded from there.
    * If not ‚Üí data is fetched from the public API.
  * Whenever the todos, users or the logged-in user change, the localStorage data is updated accordingly.
* "Reset App" Button:
  * Clears localStorage and reloads the app, fetching fresh data from the API.
* Drag and Drop functionality:
  * Users can move their tasks between the two sections via drag and drop.
* Login Simulation:
  * The user inputs a username.
  * If the username exists in the list from the API ‚Üí the user logs in successfully.
  * If not ‚Üí an error message is displayed, asking the user to try again.
  * After a successful login, the login modal must be manually closed.
* Logout functionality:
  * The user can log out.
  * Logging out removes the currently logged-in user from both the application state and from localStorage.
* User permissions restrictions:
  * The logged-in user can complete/uncomplete only their own tasks.
  * The Complete/Undo buttons are only visible for the logged-in user's tasks.
  * If the user attempts to modify someone else's task, an error message is displayed indicating that they can only manage their own todos.
